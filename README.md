# Cosmic5173
Hello there! My name is Armen Deroian (He/Him), I am a student in this ever-growing world. I like to call myself the 'beginner-developer', I have been actually working around programming and computers for about 2 years (as of 2022). Computers and software engineering have always intrigued me, ever since I started random block coding back in Middle School. I say "'actually' working" because although I have been around computers and beginner coding (block code, hour of code, etc.) for many years.
 
It's very enjoyable for me to be able to turn on my PC and be able to work on *anything*. Being able to create almost anything I put my mind to gives me a sense of purpose and pride. I enjoy every last minute of it, and look forward to what I learn in the future.

## Past Projects
 
### Imperial Network
Imperial Network was my first-ever attempt at a Minecraft Network. It was founded and owned by my good friend [Zofu](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv1qaKC1bYd3A3O9r4KIB_g), and myself. This was my first time actually creating a public programming project that people could actually use. It got me to learn [PHP](https://php.net) and [PocketMine-MP](https://pmmp.io).
 
### Warped Network / Wyvern Factions
Warped Network, also known as Wyvern Factions was my second, and long term Minecraft Network. This was my most (kinda) successful Minecraft Network. It was founded and owned by [EPT](https://github.com/EPT8TPE), Atlantis, and myself.
 
### TX Servers
TX Servers was probably the most meaningful Minecraft project I worked on. This was arguably the most wholesome, welcoming, friendly, and respectful community I was ever part of on Minecraft. I joined this server around June 2020, and was part of it till its end-of-life in November 2020. This project was founded by NightmareDG and owned by NightmareDG, PoisonouseSquash, Sassy, and CouchPez.
 
### Legend Network
Legend Network was the last Minecraft Network that I worked on, and plan to work on. It was founded by ItzFighters, and owned by Optical, Magix, and myself.
